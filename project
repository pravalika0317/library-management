The Online Library Management System is a web-based application designed to help libraries efficiently manage books, users, and transactions. This system ensures smooth operations such as adding books, tracking borrowed items, and managing users through a secure and scalable platform.zzz---

1. System Components & Technologies

Frontend 

If implemented, the frontend will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface.

It will interact with the backend via RESTful API calls.


Backend

Developed using Python Flask, which provides lightweight and scalable API endpoints.

Implements business logic for handling books, users, and transactions.


Database

Uses PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database system, to store data.

SQLAlchemy ORM is used to interact with the database efficiently.


Version Control

GitHub is used for source code management, version control, and collaboration.
